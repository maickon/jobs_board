# Build A Jobs Board In Rails 4

This week I build a Jobs Board application. We have the ability to Add, Edit, Destroy jobs postings and each job post is assigned to a category, and we are able to filter between the various categories to see only jobs within that category (For example, only “Full-Time” jobs).
